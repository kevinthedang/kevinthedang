### Introduction
Hello! My name is Kevin Dang and I'm an experienced software developer who loves making things that are totally useless just to learn.

My Alma Mater, Gonzaga University, posted a [short article](https://www.gonzaga.edu/news-events/stories/2024/8/30/discord-bot) about my main project. Kinda cool.

Hardware Projects:
* [Live Bluetooth Scanner](https://github.com/kevinthedang/bluetooth-smart-scanner)

List/Info Projects:
* [List Vault](https://github.com/kevinthedang/lists-vault): Setup for Services and Languages on my Home Server
* [Ravenfield Modding and 3D Modeling](https://github.com/kevinthedang/ravenfield-modding): Ravenfield is a fun game and I want to learn how to make mods for it!

Main Project: 
* [Discord Bot that uses Ollama](https://github.com/kevinthedang/discord-ollama): Discord Chatbot

I am trying to learn the following:
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Ravenfield Modding](https://github.com/kevinthedang/ravenfield-modding)
* 3D Modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* Server Management and Adding Services
* [Orange PI](http://www.orangepi.org/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) stuff
* Electrical/Computer Engineering fun stuff
* Put content on youtube since sometimes Documentation on GitHub is usually just for me lol
